### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I have a passion for native iOS application development. UI/UX is very important for me on each project because people firstly get attracted on visualization and then being using that application easily or not. 
- I improve my skills on Swift and iOS Development. With that I develop the mobile applications with a full responsibility, not just coding. 
- I follow the popular applications about what they are doing.
- I have experience with Realm, Core Data, Core Locations,Firebase, Facebook iOS SDK, Restful APIs, SnapKit, Moya, MapKit, MVVM, MVC.
